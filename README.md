## Java BrainFuck Interpreter

This is a BrainFuck interpreter I made using Java.

I learned BrainFuck first, learning the basics as a joke with some friends. As I started to learn the language better I felt comfortable enough to make a simple interpreter for the goofy little language.

This was a blast to make, and I hope you get an enjoyable headache while programming in this language!

I included 3 sample bf files as well as the interpreter.


Please make a pull request or issue report if you have any other sample files you want to add or if there are any bugs with the interpreter.
